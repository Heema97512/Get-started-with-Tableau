# Get-started-with-TABLEAU
Interactive visualization of data using Tableau

HELLO GUYS!!
Here we are going to see how fun while working with taleau!!
I just created a data in the excel sheet and represented those data in Tableau in visualized form
its quite amazing when you see those data in the form of charts,Maps its quite easy to do in Tableau.
STEP 1:
      The first step is that you have to install Tableau from https://www.tableau.com it will allow you you to use the tool as a trial version of 15days.
Step 2:
        Then click connect to>>Excel 
        select the desired file from the desktop and it loads your file in table
Step 3:
      ![sheet1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26022346/25323608/0e835178-28de-11e7-8dee-799eee388547.jpg)
your excel data is loaded

Step 4:
      click sheet in bottom generate a new sheet
      after creating a create you can find the data pane which is at the left there are two divisions in it 
      1.Dimensions
      2.Measures
      according to my file it has state and citycomes under dimensions since,it cannot be measurable
      
![sheet2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26022346/25323634/2d6ca42c-28de-11e7-9eb2-c1d1fa081a81.jpg)
drag the attributes such as state in ROWSSO THAT THE STATES are been visualized then YOU find the state values as Abc some dummy values
So, you need to drag POPULATION from MEASURES NEXT TO STATE 
IF YOU WANT TO ADD CRIME RATE YOU CAN ADD IT FROM MEASURES
1.YOU CAN CHANGE THE MEASURE VALUES AS SUM,COUNT,MAX e.g(if you want to view avg crimerate,total crimerate..etc CAN BE DONE USING MEASURE VALUES THERE EXISTS a drop down listbox where you can add them.
2.THUS,we can modify it using the measure values.

Step 5:
Now,WE Can represent the population using the bar chart!!
drag and drop the Population under SIZE,COLOR,LABEL IN THAT so you can view the data in bar chart

Step 6: 
MAP REPRESENTATION OF CRIMERATE
    If you want to generate a map you need to represent those in latitude and longitude so Right click STATE IN DIMENSION UNDER GEOGRAPHIC ROLE CLICK
    YOU WILL FIND GLOBE SYMBOL IN THAT ..
    SELECT MAP FROM SHOW ME..
![sheet4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26022346/25323649/66c8a4be-28de-11e7-9071-dd6dbf317967.jpg)
DRAG AND DROP the desired attributes under the COLOR,SIZE,LABEL you will generate the map with those components...
SUPPOSE ,if u get unknown at the bottom it means you havenot recoginsed the correct states so,you need to represnt them by clicking UNKNOWN generate the correct India in country..

STEP 7:
BARCHART REPRESENTATION OF STATES AND ITS POPULATION
       Next window displays the Barchart view of Data,
       YOU can represnt the data with bar chart and size of the data in the bar chart Vary according to its size of population.
       DRAG AND DROP THE POPULATION UNDER THE SIZE...
      
![sheet5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/26022346/25323661/86dc7186-28de-11e7-9e64-e9eade003163.jpg)
YOU CAN CHANGE COLOR BY DRAG AND DROP THE POPULATION UNDER COLOR
ADD LABEL IF YOU WANT TO ADD BY DRAG AND DROP UNDER LABEL.
STEP 8:
     MAP REPRESENTATION OF POPULATION IN OUR COUNTRY
     we can represent indivual attributes in separate map if you want to visualize it..
     so follow the same procedure as above mentioned,,

 yeah!! thats the way we can represent the data in easy manner using tableau ,,,
 its just representation of data in maps,bar charts...
 
 THANK YOU,HOPE YOU ALL FIND IT USEFULL!!!!!!!
